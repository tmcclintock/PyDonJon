DonJuan
=========

A translation/rebuild of the original `donjon dungeon generator <https://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/dungeon/>`_.
This package aims to deconstruct the original script into extendable parts, and provide all pieces
for customization for different purposes and not just the map image. For example, when complete this package
will automatically generate walls, doors, and light sources for use in
`Foundry Virtual Tabletop <https://foundryvtt.com/>`_.

You can find the `documentation here <https://donjuan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

This is a work in progress.
